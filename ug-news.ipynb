Sheikh-Yahaya-Ibrahim-Kakungulu.jpg “I appeal to whoever sights the moon on Friday evening to contact me immediately for verification,” Kakungulu said. RELIGION | IDD | RAMADHAN |UGANDAMuslims will on Friday evening know when Idd el-Fitr which marks the end of their fasting, be celebrated.According to the Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC), Director of Sharia, Sheikh Yahaya Ibrahim Kakungulu, Friday will be the 29th day since Muslims commenced fasting on April 24.Kakungulu has advised Muslims to look out for the moon on Friday evening.\\xa0“I implore Muslims and other trusted members of the public, to look out for the moon on Friday evening since it is the 29th day of the holy month of Ramadhan,” Kakungulu said. He noted that if the moon is sighted on Friday evening, Idd will be celebrated on Saturday but if it is not sighted, it will automatically be marked on Sunday.However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, there will be no communal prayers in the mosque.The month of Ramadhan in which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset on a daily basis, lasts between 29 to 30 days.Fasting is the fourth pillar of the Islamic religion and it is considered a special month of the Islamic religion in which the Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Fasting is observed annually.Kakungulu who is the only sheikh in the country authorised to announce Idd day appealed to those who would sight the moon to contact him immediately on the following numbers 0702/0772-525-171 or 0772588316.“I appeal to whoever sights the moon on Friday evening to contact me immediately for verification,” Kakungulu said.He warned that only people with sober minds with no disputed integrity are supposed to contact him about moon sighting.\\xa0“Information from subsequent liars is not accepted,” Kakungulu said.\\xa0Pay zakat before IddMeanwhile, the Mufti of Uganda Sheikh Ramadhan Mubajje, has urged Muslims to pay Zakat al-Fitr before Idd prayers despite the COVID-19 lockdown.\\xa0 He explained that payment of Zakat al-Fitr perfects ones fasting.“Most of our fasting comes with shortfalls. However, Prophet Muhammad encouraged us to pay Zakat al-Fitr,\\xa0 saying that one’s fasting will be hanging between earth and heavens and it will not be raised up to the divine presence without paying the Zakat al-Fitr,” Mubajje said.Zakat al-Fitr is a charity taken to the poor, a few days before the end of fasting in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\\xa0 \\xa0Fitr is the same as Iftar meaning breaking the fast. Mubajje noted that every Muslim is required to pay Zakat al-Fitr at the conclusion of the month of Ramadhan as a token of thankfulness to God for having enabled them to observe the obligatory fast.\\xa0Sheikh Imran Ssali, an Imam at Gadaffi national mosque, said the amount of Zakat al –Fitr is the same for everyone regardless of their varying economic status.“Unlike Zakatul- Mali which is only supposed to be paid by wealthy Muslims, every Muslim including children are supposed to pay it,” Ssali said.Zakat al-Fitr is payable in the form of cash and foodstuffs like rice, bananas, and maize among others.

       "  'text': 'Fashionistas, whichever mask you opt for, at least make sure it caters for your health, the event you are headed to, and your outfit all in one. Youths slaying in face masks Fashionistas, whichever mask you opt for, at least make sure it caters for your health, the event you are headed to, and your outfit all in one. By Sauda Nabatanzi The whole Covid-19 situation seems to be changing many aspects of life around the world. The health crisis is turning tables that none of us thought were even moveable. Changes in social aspects have been one of the most noticeable ones, from anti-socialism to compulsory wearing of face masks among others as means to curb the spread of the disease.  To the lovers of good looks and the fashion industry at large, such prevention measures are hitting hard. It is quite a huge twist of events. Let us keep in mind that such changes have come at a time in which the fashion industry is thriving. Fashion trends such as extravagant as well as luxurious hair, make-up and dress-codes are a huge part of many people’s lives right now. It is at a point where you cannot describe someone without hitting on one’s fashion preferences. So, with the new social ways of life, without a doubt there have to be new means to go about them without forgetting the fashionista you are.  Face masks and make-up There is more to a face than just the nose and lip area and even though they play such a huge role to it, it is high time we agree that desperate times call for desperate measures. With the nose and lips “taken away” from you, focusing more on other areas like the eyes, and hair is the best way to cope-up. Step-up your eye and hair game with bold but not too much eye make-up for the eyes. For the hair, wear it in a way that stylishly exposes your face and resist from styles that can crowd your face now that a portion of it is under a mask already. Hairstyles like buns and other updos that keep hair out of one’s face are really suitable in this case unlike fringes and the likes that cover a part of the face. Leila Nakaddu, one makeup artist in Kabalagala, says that although focusing on the rest of the face seems like the quickest move many are bound to take, we should not totally do away with the lips as we believe such times will pass. “It is time to give lipsticks a break and take on lip balms and moisturizers which many overlook but are handy for fashionable as well as healthy lips.“  Face masks and outfits If you can recall before the health crisis, face masks were already on the streets of fashion even though they differ with the now recommended ones where the other are more of fashion and the latter for health. Fashionistas, whichever mask you opt for, at least make sure it caters for your health, the event you are headed to, and your outfit all in one. Fashion lovers and everyone else are now comfortably uploading content of themselves on social media behind masks and if we must say, they got it!
